## Changelog Summary 

### Version 0.2.3 - Doc Update
Changelog:

### Version 0.2.2 - OCR Update
Changelog:
* Going forward due to privacy, will be making a downloadable exe that setups the app to run on local host and start the backend server so everything can be done locally and nothing is saved, although as it is nothing is being saved

* Using Canvas to pre-process the photo to allow for better readability.

### Version 0.2.1 - OCR Processor
Changelog:
* Due to issues within v0.2.1-alpha using tesseract not displaying proper results; decided to switch to EasyOCR which upon localhost testing did net the desired results.
* Further testing is needed on handwritting or other types of photos but for the given task; the test image passed.
* Will not be including database code but will be usable when website is public
* Designed a Flask Server that recieves images from the react frontend using the image uploader; then grabs the text and returns an array of text matching ###-##-#### the desired DPCI format.
* Display results of DPCI per row and for each page with progress spinners when extracting is occuring.
